# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The Repository includes the following files:

- 'README.txt': this file, that explains the contents of the repository 'Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project'
- 'run_analysis.R': the R-Skript with which the necessary steps from raw to processed data can be traced, as long as the necessary data textfiles are (without subfolders!) in the working directory.
- 'Codebook.md'

## Background
The theme of the assignment is to show a way of getting from raw to processed data. Data are tidy when:
- every variable is in one column
- each observation is in a different row
- one table for each 'kind' of variable
- multiple tables should include a column that linked them together
- header
- readible variable names
- saved in one file per table

Not all of this points are showed  in the provided R-Skript, for several reasons.
